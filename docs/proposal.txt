Dear Prof. Pacha & Patrick,  
  
I hope this finds you well.  
  
I propose implementing the crossmaxed self-ensembler from [arxiv.org/abs/2408.05446](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05446) for the "Bring Your Own Method" project in your course "Applied Deep Learning".  
  
**For some context:** I'm really interested in adversarial machine learning. This is a hobby project of mine that I started around 1-2 weeks ago purely out of curiosity. I've tuned a RESNET152 on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100: [https://github.com/ETH-DISCO/self-ensembling](https://github.com/ETH-DISCO/self-ensembling)  
  
**My goal:** I'd love to use the linear probes to increase the explainability of the RESNET model. I'd love to benchmark it against all kinds of perturbations and see whether the impacted layers can tell us something about the kinds of features they're trained to detect.  
  
**Work-breakdown:** This is a pretty explorative / open ended project. I might use the results for our next paper – but I'm not sure yet. Getting so far already took me around 200 hours and I think (1) benchmarking the model against state-of-the art adversarial attacks, (2) creating my own test sets with specific stimuli, and (3) visualizing the results will probably take me another 100 hours. So it should be perfect for the scope of this course.  
  
I'm excited about the potential to contribute to this field and would greatly appreciate your consideration.  
  
Best regards,  
Yahya
