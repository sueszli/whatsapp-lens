<!-- Presentation
Prepare and record a presentation that we will watch together in the last two lectures during
class. The video must not be longer than four minutes. The first two minutes of that video should
contain a quick introduction into your topic, the selected approach and the final results. The
remaining two minutes should focus on insights that you want to share with your colleagues and
ideally a small demo of the project.
Please record yourself giving the presentation in the best quality available, upload your
presentation to YouTube, and send me the link. You can use free software like Davinci Resolve to
edit your videos. The videos will not be made public, unless you want to. I will collect all the
videos and create a playlist that we will watch together with one or two questions in between
presentations. Please don’t flag the video as “specially made for children” or I won’t be able to
put it into a playlist -->

this is my second project - the previous one was built around a research project

research questions:

- do i have any friends?
- how close are we?
